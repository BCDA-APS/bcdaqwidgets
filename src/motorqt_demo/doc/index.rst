motorqt-demo
============

This project shows the process of building a Qt-based application
as a series of Python class objects.

Starters
--------

It is also interesting to review a few more basic routines showing
how a simple GUI code is built in Qt without using class objects, 
then that same code with class objects. 

:EPICS Probe:
	https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/bcdaext/qtprobe-demo/docs/build/html/probe.html

Another useful code is the PyQt4-probe application, showing how
the EPICS Probe application can be built with Python, PyEpics, 
and PyQt4 (Python support for Qt4).

.. TODO: reference the :PyQt4 Probe: code here


Now, our application, built in parts
