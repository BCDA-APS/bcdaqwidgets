motorqt-demo
============

This project shows the process of building a Qt-based application
as a series of Python class objects.

Starters
------------

It is also interesting to review a few more basic routines showing
how a simple GUI code is built in Qt without using class objects, 
then that same code with class objects.

:PySide Basics:

Another useful code is the pyside-probe application, showing how
the EPICS Probe application can be built with Python, PyEpics, 
and PySide (Python support for Qt4).
